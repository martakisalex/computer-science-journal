  - Ensuring the solution has exactly one result and does not use the same element twice.
  - Involves array manipulation and efficient searching techniques.
- **Input/Output**:
  - Input: An array of integers (`nums`), and a target integer (`target`).
  - Output: An array of two integers, representing the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.
- **Data Structures Used**:
  - Hash table (to store numbers and their indices from the array).
- **Algorithms Used**:
  - One-pass Hash Table (to check for the complement of each number and store numbers in the hash table simultaneously).
- **Time Complexity**:
  - O(n) - The list is traversed only once, and each look-up in the hash table costs O(1) time.
- **Space Complexity**:
  - O(n) - Extra space is required for the hash table, which in the worst case needs to store all elements from the array.

####  **Solution Approach**:
- Utilized a hash table (dictionary in Python) to store and quickly access the numbers encountered in the array.
- Iterated through the array using a `for` loop with `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the value of each item in the array.
- For each number, calculated its complement (target - current number) and checked if this complement already exists in the hash table.
- If the complement was found, returned the indices of the current number and its complement as the solution.
- Otherwise, stored the current number with its index in the hash table for future reference.

####  **Challenges & Overcoming Them**:
- Ensuring efficient lookup to find if the complement of a number exists in the array.
- Overcame this by using a hash table for O(1) lookup time, significantly reducing the overall time complexity.

#### **Key Takeaways**:
- The `enumerate` function in Python is extremely useful for looping through items in a list while having access to both the item and its index.
- Using a hash table to store and access data can greatly optimize the solution, especially for problems involving pair finding or complement checks.
- Always consider the trade-off between time and space complexity. Here, using extra space for the hash table improved time efficiency.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - O(h) - Recursion stack space, where h is the height of the tree.

####  **Solution Approach**:
- Implemented a recursive function to invert the tree.
- Checked if the current node is not `None`. If not, swapped the left and right children of the node.
- Recursively called the function on the left and right children of the current node.

####  **Challenges & Overcoming Them**:
- Initially used a `while` loop instead of an `if` statement, which was incorrect for the recursive approach.
- Corrected the approach to apply recursion, calling the `invertTree` method on each child node.

#### **Key Takeaways**:
- Understanding that recursion is suitable for tree problems, as it naturally follows the tree's structure.
- Recognizing the difference between using a `while` loop and an `if` statement in the context of recursion.
- Time Complexity (O(n)): The function visits each node exactly once, hence the linear time complexity. In a tree traversal, the number of recursive calls is equal to the number of nodes.
- Space Complexity (O(h)): The space complexity is determined by the height of the tree due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (a skewed tree), the recursion can go as deep as the tree's height.

####  **Solution Approach**:
- Created a dictionary `letter_dict` to count the frequency of each character in `s`.
- Iterated through `t`, decreasing the count of each character in `letter_dict`. Returned `False` if a character was not found or its count was zero.
- Checked if all counts in `letter_dict` were zero, which is necessary to confirm an anagram.

####  **Challenges & Overcoming Them**:
- Discovered that the order of conditions in `if letter_dict[letter] > 0 and letter in letter_dict` can lead to an error because the key might not exist in the dictionary. Learned that reversing the order to `if letter in letter_dict and letter_dict[letter] > 0` avoids this issue by ensuring the key exists before accessing its value.

#### **Key Takeaways**:
- The importance of considering the order of conditions in a logical statement to avoid key errors in dictionaries.

  - O(1) - Constant, as no extra space is used proportional to the input size.

####  **Solution Approach**:
- Used `left` and `right` pointers to maintain the current search space, improving clarity over using variables like `i` and `j`.
- Calculated the midpoint `mid` as `(left + right) // 2` to determine the current element to compare with the target.
- Used a `while left <= right:` loop, ensuring that the element at the current `mid` is also checked.
- Incremented `left` to `mid + 1` and decremented `right` to `mid - 1` when adjusting the search space to prevent infinite loops.

####  **Challenges & Overcoming Them**:
- Initially failed to update `left` and `right` correctly, leading to incorrect results. Fixed by properly incrementing/decrementing the `mid` index.
- Learned about an alternative midpoint calculation method to prevent integer overflow: `mid = left + (right - left) // 2`.

#### **Key Takeaways**:

####  **Solution Approach**:
- Implemented a recursive function to find the LCA.
- The function returns the current node if it matches either `p` or `q`, or if it reaches a leaf node (`None`).
- Recursively searches for `p` and `q` in the left and right subtrees.
- If both left and right recursive calls return non-null values, the current node is the LCA.
- If only one of the recursive calls returns a non-null value, that value is propagated up as the potential LCA.

#### **Key Takeaways**:
- Understanding how recursion can effectively traverse a binary tree to find the LCA.
- Learning the importance of checking both subtrees and how the presence of `p` and `q` in different subtrees indicates the current node is the LCA.
- Realizing that the LCA is the deepest node at which the paths to `p` and `q` diverge.

- **Data Structures Used**:
  - None, just variables for binary search.
- **Algorithms Used**:
  - Binary Search.
- **Time Complexity**:
  - O(log(n)) - Binary search cuts the problem size in half with each step.
- **Space Complexity**:
  - O(1) - Constant space is used.

####  **Solution Approach**:
- Implemented binary search with two pointers, `left` and `right`.
- In the loop, `mid` is calculated and checked if it's a bad version using `isBadVersion`.
- If `mid` is bad, search the left half; otherwise, search the right half.

#### **Explanation of Conditional Logic**:
- When `isBadVersion(mid)` returns `True`, it means that `mid` could potentially be the first bad version, or the first bad version could be to its left. Thus, `right` is set to `mid` to continue searching in the left half, including `mid`.
- When `isBadVersion(mid)` is `False`, it means that `mid` and all versions before it are good. Therefore, the first bad version must be after `mid`. This is why `left` is set to `mid + 1`, as it safely excludes `mid` and all previous versions.
- This approach ensures that the first bad version is correctly identified while minimizing the number of API calls.

#### **Key Takeaways**:
- Understanding the intricacies of binary search and how subtle changes in the condition and update steps can optimize performance.
- The importance of minimizing API calls in scenarios where each call may be costly or have a performance impact.

#### **Additional Notes**:
- This problem is an excellent example of applying binary search in a practical scenario, demonstrating the importance of efficient searching in large datasets.

### 17. [Longest Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome/)

#### **Problem Overview**:
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Key Problem Aspects**:
  - Finding the length of the longest palindrome that can be built with the letters in a given string `s`.
- **Input/Output**:
  - Input: A string `s`.
  - Output: The length of the longest palindrome possible.
- **Data Structures Used**:
  - Dictionary (hash table).
- **Algorithms Used**:
  - Frequency counting using hash table.
- **Time Complexity**:
  - O(n) - Linear, iterating through each character in the string once.
- **Space Complexity**:
  - O(1) or O(c) - Where `c` is the size of the character set. The dictionary will contain at most `c` key-value pairs, where `c` is fixed for a specific character set (e.g., 26 for lowercase English letters).

####  **Solution Approach**:
- Used a dictionary `letters_count` to count the frequency of each character in `s`.
- Iterated through the dictionary to calculate the length of the longest palindrome:
  - Added the count of characters with even frequencies directly to `longest_length`.
  - For characters with odd frequencies, added their count minus one, and set a flag `has_odd`.
- If any odd counts were found, one additional character could be placed in the center of the palindrome.

#### **Explanation of Modulo Operator and Flag Usage**:
- The modulo operator (`%`) is used to determine if the count of a character is odd or even.
- If `letters_count[letter] % 2 == 0`, it implies an even count. For odd counts, we add one less than the count to `longest_length` and raise the `has_odd` flag.
- The `has_odd` flag indicates whether at least one character with an odd count is present, allowing for a single odd-count character to be used as the center of the palindrome.

#### **Key Takeaways**:
- Understanding the significance of the modulo operator in differentiating between even and odd counts.
- The use of a flag (`has_odd`) to track the presence of odd-count characters efficiently.
- The importance of considering each character's count for constructing a palindrome with the maximum possible length.

#### **Additional Notes**:
- This problem is a good exercise in understanding the construction rules of a palindrome and applying frequency counting techniques.
- The approach demonstrates a pattern often used in problems where constructing an optimal structure based on frequency counts is required.

- The pattern of using a temporary variable to hold the next node before changing links is a common and crucial technique in many linked list problems.

### 19. [Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)

#### **Problem Overview**:
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Key Problem Aspects**:
  - Finding the majority element in an array, which appears more than `n/2` times.
- **Input/Output**:
  - Input: An array of integers `nums`.
  - Output: The majority element.
- **Data Structures Used**:

- **Space Complexity**:
  - O(1) - Constant space, using only a couple of variables.

####  **Solution Approach**:
- Implemented the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm to find the majority element.
- Maintained two variables: `maj_element` to store the current candidate for majority element and `vote` to track its count.
- Iterated through the array:
  - If `vote` is zero, set `maj_element` to the current number and `vote` to 1.
  - If the current number is equal to `maj_element`, incremented `vote`.
  - Otherwise, decremented `vote`.
- The number in `maj_element` after the iteration is the majority element.

### 20. [Add Binary](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-binary/)

#### **Problem Overview**:
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Key Problem Aspects**:
  - Adding two binary strings and returning the result as a binary string.
- **Input/Output**:
  - Input: Two binary strings `a` and `b`.
  - Output: The sum of `a` and `b` as a binary string.
- **Data Structures Used**:
  - String manipulation.
- **Algorithms Used**:
  - Simulation of binary addition.
- **Time Complexity**:
  - O(n + m) - Where `n` is the length of string `a` and `m` is the length of string `b`.
- **Space Complexity**:
  - O(max(n, m)) - The length of the result string could be at most `max(n, m) + 1`.

####  **Solution Approach**:
- Initialized pointers `i` and `j` at the ends of strings `a` and `b` to simulate addition from the least significant bit.
- Used a `while` loop to iterate through the strings as long as there is at least one character left in either string or there is a carry.
- Summed up the bits pointed by `i` and `j`, along with the `carry`.

#### **Explanation of Key Lines**:
- `carry = total // 2`: This line calculates the carry for the next iteration. Since we're adding binary digits, the carry will be `1` if the sum is `2` or `3` (since `2 // 2 = 1` and `3 // 2 = 1`), and `0` if the sum is `0` or `1` (since `0 // 2 = 0` and `1 // 2 = 0`).
- `result = str(total % 2) + result`: This line calculates the current digit to be added to the result. The `% 2` operation gives the remainder when `total` is divided by `2`, which effectively determines the least significant bit of the sum. This bit is then converted to a string and concatenated to the left side of the `result`, building the binary result from right to left.

#### **Key Takeaways**:
- Understanding how to simulate binary addition manually, handling carries between digits.
- The importance of iterating from the least significant bit to the most significant bit in binary operations.
- Utilizing integer division `//` and modulus `%` to manage carries and current digits effectively in binary addition.

#### **Additional Notes**:

#### **Problem Overview**:
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Key Problem Aspects**:
  - Finding the diameter of a binary tree, defined as the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
- **Input/Output**:
  - Input: The root of a binary tree (`root`).
  - Output: The diameter of the tree.
- **Data Structures Used**:
  - Binary Tree.
- **Algorithms Used**:
  - Depth-First Search (DFS).
- **Time Complexity**:
  - O(n) - Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**:
  - O(h) - The recursion stack may go as deep as the height of the tree.

####  **Solution Approach**:
- Utilized a Depth-First Search (DFS) helper function to explore the tree.
- Created an instance variable `self.max_diameter` to keep track of the maximum diameter found during the traversal.
- In the `dfs` function:
  - Returned 0 for null nodes to signify the end of a path.
  - Recursively obtained the maximum path lengths from the left and right children.
  - Updated `self.max_diameter` with the sum of left and right path lengths if it's larger than the current maximum.
  - Returned the maximum of the left or right path length plus one to account for the current node's depth.

#### **Key Insights**:
- The use of an instance variable (`self.max_diameter`) allows tracking the maximum diameter found across recursive calls without needing to pass it as an argument.
- The `dfs` helper function, being a nested function, can access and modify the instance variable, facilitating the update of the maximum diameter found.
- Returning `max(left, right) + 1` from each `dfs` call ensures that only the longest path from each node contributes to the diameter calculation.

#### **Additional Notes**:
- This problem is an excellent example of how a global (or in this case, instance-wide) variable can be used in conjunction with a recursive function to maintain state across recursive calls.
- The solution illustrates a common pattern in tree problems where a value needs to be updated based on recursive calls' results, showcasing the utility of Depth-First Search in such scenarios.

### 22. [Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)

#### **Problem Overview**:
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Key Problem Aspects**:
  - Identifying the middle node in a singly linked list. In cases with two middle nodes, the second one should be returned.
- **Input/Output**:
  - Input: The `head` of a singly linked list.
  - Output: The middle node of the linked list. If there are two middle nodes, the second one is returned.
- **Data Structures Used**:
  - Singly Linked List.
- **Algorithms Used**:
  - Two-pointer technique (slow and fast pointers).
- **Time Complexity**:
  - O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list. The fast pointer, moving at twice the speed of the slow pointer, ensures the list is traversed only once.
- **Space Complexity**:
  - O(1), as the space used does not scale with the size of the input linked list.

#### **Solution Approach**:
- Initiated two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both pointing to `head` at the start.
- Advanced `slow` by one node and `fast` by two nodes in each step until `fast` reaches the end of the list or becomes `null`.
- By the time `fast` reaches the end, `slow` will be at the middle of the list. In cases with an even number of nodes, when `fast` becomes `null`, `slow` will be at the second middle node, fulfilling the problem's requirement.

#### **Key Insights**:
- The loop condition `while fast and fast.next:` is crucial. Using just `while fast:` could cause an error when attempting to access `fast.next.next` if `fast` is at the last node. Similarly, `while fast.next:` alone might not account for `fast` becoming `None`, leading to a potential error when checking `fast.next`.
- This approach ensures that `slow` ends up at the second middle node in lists with an even number of nodes because `fast` moves two steps at a time. When `fast` can no longer advance two steps (either because it hits `None` or its next is `None`), the loop ends, leaving `slow` at the second middle node.

#### **Additional Notes**:
- This problem is a classic example of the utility of the fast and slow pointer technique in solving linked list problems, especially those involving the identification of specific nodes based on list length.
- The simplicity and elegance of the solution highlight the power of pointer manipulation in algorithm design for linked list data structures. The careful consideration of loop conditions to avoid errors is a key aspect of robust algorithm implementation.

### 23. [Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

#### **Problem Overview**:
- **Difficulty**: Easy

  - Output: The maximum depth of the tree, represented as an integer.
- **Data Structures Used**:
  - Binary Tree.
- **Algorithms Used**:
  - Depth-First Search (DFS), Recursion.
- **Time Complexity**:
  - O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**:
  - O(h), where `h` is the height of the tree. This accounts for the recursion stack.

####  **Solution Approach**:
- Implemented a recursive function that traverses the tree using DFS.
- For each node, the function recursively finds the maximum depth of its left and right subtrees.
- The maximum of the depths of the left and right subtrees is taken, and `1` is added to account for the depth of the current node.
- The base case is when the function encounters a `None` node, at which point it returns `0`. This ensures that an integer is always returned, maintaining consistency with the expected return type.

####  **Challenges & Overcoming Them**:
- Ensuring that the base case returns `0` instead of `None` was crucial for maintaining the integer return type throughout the recursive calls, which is essential for the addition operations in the recursion.

#### **Key Takeaways**:
- The depth of a node in a binary tree is the maximum depth of its subtrees plus one.
- Handling the base case correctly is crucial in recursive algorithms, especially in ensuring that the return types are consistent with the operations performed in the recursion.

#### **Additional Notes**:
- This problem is a fundamental example of applying recursion to tree data structures, demonstrating the elegance and simplicity of recursive solutions for tree traversal and manipulation tasks.

####  **Solution Approach**:
- Converted the input list into a set, which automatically removes duplicates.
- Compared the length of the set with the original list. If the set's length is less than the list's, it indicates there were duplicates in the list.

####  **Challenges & Overcoming Them**:
- The primary challenge was to find an efficient way to check for duplicates without having to compare each element with every other element, which would lead to a less efficient solution.
- Utilizing a set to hold the elements and leveraging its property of containing unique elements provided an efficient solution.

  - Dynamic Programming, Kadane's Algorithm.
- **Time Complexity**:
  - O(n), where `n` is the length of the array. Each element is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**:
  - O(1), as only two variables (`max_sum` and `current_sum`) are used, regardless of the input size.

####  **Solution Approach**:
- Initialized `max_sum` and `current_sum` with the first element of `nums` to handle the case where `nums` contains only one element or all negative numbers.
- Iterated through the array starting from the second element.
- For each element, updated `current_sum` by taking the maximum between the current element added to `current_sum` and the current element itself. This decision ensures that `current_sum` always represents the maximum sum of the current subarray.
- Updated `max_sum` to hold the maximum value between the current `max_sum` and the new `current_sum`. This ensures that `max_sum` always holds the largest sum encountered so far.
- Returned `max_sum` as the result.

#### **Key Takeaways**:
- Kadane's Algorithm is an efficient way to solve the maximum subarray problem by maintaining a running sum and updating the maximum sum found at each step.

- **Time Complexity**:
  - O(n), where `n` is the number of intervals. Each interval is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**:
  - O(n), in the worst case, all intervals might be merged into the new interval, requiring a new list.

####  **Solution Approach**:
- Initialized an empty list `new_intervals` to store the result.
- Used three `while` loops to process intervals before, overlapping with, and after the `newInterval`.
1. **First While Loop**: Added intervals to `new_intervals` that end before `newInterval` starts, ensuring no overlap.
2. **Second While Loop**: Merged intervals that overlap with `newInterval` by updating `newInterval` to the encompassing interval, then added it to `new_intervals`.
3. **Third While Loop**: Added the remaining intervals that start after `newInterval` ends.
- Returned `new_intervals` as the final list of merged intervals.

#### **Key Takeaways**:
- Efficiently handling interval merging by categorizing intervals into three groups: before, overlapping, and after the new interval.
- The use of a temporary interval (`newInterval`) for merging overlapping intervals simplifies the logic and reduces complexity.
