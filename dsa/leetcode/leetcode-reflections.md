# LeetCode Reflections

This Markdown file serves as a personal repository of insights, strategies, and key learnings from my journey through LeetCode problems. For each problem tackled, it documents:

- **Problem Overview**: A brief summary of each LeetCode problem, including its title, difficulty level, and key concepts involved.

- **Solution Approach**: My approach to solving the problem, including initial thoughts, algorithms used, and any specific programming techniques or data structures employed.

- **Challenges & Overcoming Them**: Challenges encountered while solving the problem and how I addressed them. This could include debugging issues, optimizing for time or space complexity, or understanding the problem's intricacies.

- **Key Takeaways**: Crucial lessons learned from each problem, encompassing algorithmic insights, coding best practices, and any new programming concepts discovered or reinforced.

- **Additional Notes**: Any extra observations, such as comparisons to similar problems, alternative solutions explored, and references to helpful resources or discussions.

This file is not just a record of problems solved but a reflection of my growth as a programmer. It's a living document, evolving with each problem I solve and each new insight I gain.
