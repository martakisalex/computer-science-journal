# Algorithm Topics

1. One-pass Hash Table: Used in solving the Two Sum problem to efficiently find pairs that sum up to a target.
2. Stack-based Validation: Employed for matching pairs of parentheses in the Valid Parentheses problem.
3. Two-pointer Technique: Applied in merging two sorted lists and in various other problems for efficient traversal and manipulation of data structures.
4. Single Pass Linear Scan: Utilized in finding the best time to buy and sell stock by scanning through the price list once.
5. String Filtering and Comparison: Used for checking palindrome validity after preprocessing the string.
6. Tree Traversal and Recursion: Applied in several problems like inverting a binary tree, finding the maximum depth of a binary tree, and determining the diameter of a binary tree.
7. Frequency Counting using Hash Table: Employed in problems like Valid Anagram and Ransom Note for efficient character or element frequency analysis.
8. Binary Search: A fundamental algorithm used for searching in a sorted array, as seen in the Binary Search problem.
9. Depth-First Search (DFS): Used in problems like Flood Fill for exploring and modifying grid or matrix structures, and in tree problems for traversal and computations.
10. Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm: Utilized in the Majority Element problem to find the majority element in a linear time with constant space.
11. Dynamic Programming: Applied in problems like Climbing Stairs for optimizing the calculation of distinct ways to reach the top, and in Maximum Subarray (Kadane's Algorithm) for finding the maximum sum subarray.
12. Fast and Slow Pointer Technique: Used in detecting cycles in a linked list and finding the middle of a linked list.
13. Simulation of Binary Addition: Employed in Add Binary for manually performing binary addition of two strings.
