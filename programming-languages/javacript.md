## Introduction to JavaScript
JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It lets us add interactivity to pages e.g. you might have seen sliders, alerts, click interactions, popups, etc on different websites — all of that is built using JavaScript. Apart from being used in the browser, it is also used in other non-browser environments as well such as Node.js for writing server-side code in JavaScript, Electron for writing desktop applications, React Native for mobile applications, and so on.

### What is JavaScript?
JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It lets us add interactivity to pages e.g. you might have seen sliders, alerts, click interactions, popups, etc on different websites — all of that is built using JavaScript. Apart from being used in the browser, it is also used in other non-browser environments as well such as Node.js for writing server-side code in JavaScript, Electron for writing desktop applications, React Native for mobile applications, and so on.

### History of JavaScript
JavaScript was initially created by Brendan Eich of NetScape and was first announced in a press release by Netscape in 1995. It has a bizarre history of naming; initially, it was named Mocha by the creator, which was later renamed LiveScript. In 1996, about a year later after the release, NetScape decided to rename it to JavaScript with hopes of capitalizing on the Java community (although JavaScript did not have any relationship with Java) and released Netscape 2.0 with the official support of JavaScript.

### JavaScript Versions

JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich, and in 1997 it became an ECMA standard. ECMAScript is the official language name. ECMAScript versions include ES1, ES2, ES3, ES5, and ES6

### How to run JavaScript
JavaScript can be run in the browser by including the external script file using the `script` tag, writing it within the HTML page using the `script` tag again, or running it in the browser console.

### Javascript Variables
Most of the time, a JavaScript application needs to work with information. To store and represent this information in the JavaScript codebase, we use variables. A variable is a container for a value.

### Variable Declarations
To use variables in JavaScript, we first need to create it i.e. declare a variable. To declare variables, we use one of the var, let, or const keywords.

### [var] keyword
The `var` statement declares a function-scoped or globally-scoped variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

### [let] keyword
The `let` declaration declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

### [const] keyword
Constants are block-scoped, much like variables declared using the let keyword. The value of a constant can’t be changed through reassignment (i.e. by using the assignment operator), and it can’t be redeclared (i.e. through a variable declaration). However, if a constant is an object or array its properties or items can be updated or removed.

### Hoisting
JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables, or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.
