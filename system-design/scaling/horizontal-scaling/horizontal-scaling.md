## Overview

Horizontal scaling, also known as scaling out, involves adding more machines or nodes to a pool of resources to manage an increased load. It is a strategy used to increase the capacity of a system by connecting multiple hardware or software entities so that they work as a single logical unit.

## Key Features

- **Elasticity**: Easily add or remove resources based on demand, making it highly elastic and adaptable to workload changes.
- **Load Distribution**: Distributes the overall load across multiple servers, reducing the burden on a single machine.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Enhanced fault tolerance, as the failure of one node does not significantly impact the overall system's availability.

## Advantages

- **Scalability**: Effectively manages increases in load without significant changes to the existing infrastructure.
- **Flexibility**: New nodes can be added without downtime, providing seamless scalability.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Often more cost-effective at scale compared to vertical scaling, especially with cloud-based services offering pay-as-you-go pricing.

## Use Cases

- **Web Applications**: Ideal for web applications with fluctuating traffic, where additional servers can be added to handle peak loads.
- **Distributed Systems**: Used in systems that require high availability and distributed processing, such as big data applications and microservices architectures.
- **Cloud Computing**: Fundamental to cloud computing services, allowing for the dynamic allocation of resources based on demand.

Horizontal scaling offers a robust solution for managing large-scale systems, ensuring high availability and performance even under heavy loads.
