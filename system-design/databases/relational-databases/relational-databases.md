## Overview

Relational databases are a type of database that store and provide access to data points that are related to one another. They are based on the relational model proposed by E.F. Codd, where all data is represented in terms of tuples, grouped into relations. Relational databases use Structured Query Language (SQL) for defining and manipulating the data.

## Key Features

- **Tables**: Data is organized into tables (relations) with rows (records) and columns (fields).
- **Data Integrity**: Enforces data integrity and consistency through relational constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes.
- **ACID Properties**: Ensures atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability of database transactions.
- **Normalization**: Reduces data redundancy and improves data integrity through the normalization process.

## Advantages

- **Structured Data Management**: Provides a clear structure for the data, making it easy to maintain and query.
- **Flexibility in Querying**: SQL allows for powerful and flexible data retrieval.
- **Widely Used**: Relational databases are widely adopted, with a large ecosystem of tools, best practices, and expertise.
- **Mature Technology**: Well-established technology with proven scalability, reliability, and security.

## Use Cases

- **Enterprise Applications**: Ideal for applications that require complex transactions and queries, such as financial, inventory, and human resources systems.
- **E-commerce Platforms**: Manage product catalogs, customer data, and orders.
- **Banking Systems**: Handle transactions, accounts, and customer data securely and efficiently.
- **Healthcare Systems**: Manage patient records, appointments, and medical histories.

Relational databases are versatile and widely used, offering robust support for complex data structures and transactions.
