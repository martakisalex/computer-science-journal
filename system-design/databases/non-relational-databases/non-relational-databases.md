# Non-Relational Databases

## Overview

Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are designed to handle a wide variety of data types, including structured, semi-structured, unstructured, and polymorphic data. NoSQL databases are characterized by their flexibility, scalability, and high performance, making them suitable for big data and real-time web applications.

## Key Features

- **Schema-less**: Data can be stored without a predefined schema, making it flexible to accommodate changes.
- **Scalability**: Designed for horizontal scalability, distributing data across multiple servers.
- **Data Models**: Support diverse data models including document, key-value, wide-column, and graph databases.
- **Performance**: Optimized for specific data models, offering high performance for read and write operations.

## Advantages

- **Flexibility**: Easily adapts to changes and variations in data structure.
- **Scalability**: Efficiently scales
