# Web Servers

## Overview
Web servers are software systems that deliver web content or services to users over the internet. They handle HTTP requests from clients, typically web browsers, and serve them web pages, images, and other types of content.

## Key Features
- **HTTP Request Handling**: Process requests via HTTP and provide responses with the requested content.
- **Static Content Delivery**: Serve static content like HTML pages, images, and style sheets.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overloaded.
- **SSL/TLS Encryption**: Support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols to secure communications.

## Common Web Servers
- Apache HTTP Server
- Nginx
- Microsoft IIS
- LiteSpeed

## Use Cases
- Hosting websites, both static and dynamic, when combined with application servers.
- Reverse proxying, load balancing, and caching to improve website performance and reliability.
