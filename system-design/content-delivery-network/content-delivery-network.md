## Overview

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. The goal is to provide high availability and performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end-users. CDNs serve a large portion of the Internet content today, including web objects (text, graphics, and scripts), downloadable objects (media files, software, documents), applications (e-commerce, portals), live streaming media, on-demand streaming media, and social networks.

## Key Features

- **Global Reach**: CDNs are spread across the globe to reduce the distance between the users and website resources.
- **Caching**: Stores copies of content in multiple locations to provide faster access and reduce bandwidth costs.
- **Load Balancing**: Efficiently distributes network traffic and requests to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed.
- **Security**: Offers protection against common attacks like DDoS, as well as secure token authentication.

## Advantages

- **Speed and Performance**: By caching content closer to the end-users, CDNs reduce latency and improve site load times.
- **Scalability**: Easily accommodates traffic spikes and growing audiences without requiring significant infrastructure changes.
- **Reliability**: Ensures higher availability of content through redundant, distributed networks.
- **Bandwidth Cost Savings**: Reduces the amount of data an origin server must provide, thereby reducing hosting costs for website operators.

## Use Cases

- **Website and Web Application Acceleration**: Enhances the speed and performance of websites and web applications.
- **Video Streaming**: Supports large-scale video platforms with high-quality, uninterrupted streaming.
- **Software Distribution**: Facilitates the efficient distribution of software updates, downloads, and patches.
- **Game Delivery and Updates**: Ensures fast and reliable delivery of game content and updates.

CDNs are an essential part of the Internet's infrastructure, providing the backbone through which a significant portion of the Internet's content is delivered to end-users.
