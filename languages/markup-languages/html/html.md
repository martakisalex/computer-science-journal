## Overview

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript to create structured web pages.

## Key Features

- **Structural Semantics**: Provides a means to structure documents with elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and more.
- **Embedding Media**: Supports embedding images, audio, video, and other multimedia through appropriate tags.
- **Forms and User Input**: Facilitates the creation of forms to collect user input, which can be sent to a server for processing.
- **Hyperlinks**: Enables linking to other web pages or resources, forming the basis of the web's hypertextual nature.
- **Accessibility Features**: Offers various elements and attributes to make web content accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

## Advantages

- **Universally Supported**: Every major web browser supports HTML, making it accessible on a wide range of devices.
- **Easy to Learn**: The basics of HTML are straightforward, making it an entry point for beginners in web development.
- **Foundation of the Web**: Serves as the backbone for all web content, often used in conjunction with CSS and JavaScript for styling and interactivity.

## Use Cases

- Building the structure of web pages and web applications.
- Creating navigational elements, such as menus and site maps.
- Formatting and presenting content, including text, images, and multimedia.
- Developing forms for user interactions and data collection.

## Development Environment

- HTML documents can be created and edited in any text editor, from simple ones like Notepad to more advanced code editors like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom.
- Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) render HTML files and provide tools for debugging and inspecting HTML elements.

HTML is foundational to web development, serving as the building block for creating and structuring web content.
